- Does the project include working authentication? (DONE)
- Does the project include working authorization, including separate roles for users and admins?
- Does the project include required CRUD functionality?

User Stories:

- As an admin, I should be able to log in and log out of the application.
- As an admin, I should be able to add, update and delete products.
- As an admin, I should be able to add reviews.
- As an admin, I want to ensure that other users don't have access to CRUD functionality.
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account and add a review to a product. (A product can have many comments.) This is the only CRUD functionality a user can have.
